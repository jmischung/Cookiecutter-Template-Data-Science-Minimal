# Cookiecutter Template | Data Science - Minimal

A minimal data science project structure inspired by the structure used in Real Python's Data Version Control tutorial ([here](https://realpython.com/python-data-version-control/)) and drivendata's cookiecutter data science template ([here](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)).

### Starting a New Project
--
1. Ensure `cookiecutter` is installed.
2. In the directory where the project is to be located run `ccds github_link_here`

### Default Project Structure
--
This structure is meant for personal organization. If this project is meant to be stored and/or shared publicly a license should be added.
